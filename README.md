# Pi-Engine
A game engine, being developed as a hobby. Not yet being used for anything.

It is worth noting that I have never previously used OpenGL or any of the other libraries and frameworks used by this engine, nor have I attempted to make an engine before this, so please excuse any horrid practices and code used in this project.
