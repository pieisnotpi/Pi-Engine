# Pi-Engine
A game engine, being developed as a hobby. Not yet being used for anything.

It is worth noting that I have never previously used OpenGL or any of the other libraries and frameworks used by this engine, nor have I attempted to make an engine before this, so please excuse any horrid practices and code used in this project. 

#Using for Yourself
I don't recommend anyone use this engine, ever, but on the off-chance someone sees this and DOES want to use it,  I've included some instructions on how to use it.

<br> 1. This engine requires the following three libraries to function and has been tested on the following versions: LWJGL 3.0.0 build 83, jbox2D 2.2.1.1, and joml 1.7.1. Future versions of the stated libraries may work, but are not tested.
<br> 2. Everything in the game package is intended to be test material. If you want to run the provided test material, set the Game class as the main class.
